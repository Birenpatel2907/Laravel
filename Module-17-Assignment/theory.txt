1.         How to remove route caching?

Ans.        To cache your routes again, simply run the following command: 
	$ php artisan  route:cache  Route cache cleared! Routes cached successfully! Again, running 
	the above command alone is enough to clear your previous route cache and rebuild a new 
	one.

2.      Create custom auto using middleware. 

Ans.      Step 1- create AdminAccess mddleware
		php artisan make:middleware AdminAccess 
		
	  Step 2 Register middleware in kernal.php

		app/Http/kernal.php
		<?php
 
		namespace App\Http;
 
		use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Kernel as HttpKernel;
 

		    protected $routeMiddleware = [
        	'adminAccess' => \App\Http\Middleware\AdminAccess::class,
    		];
		}
   	 Step 3 add route	
                  Route::group(['middleware'=>[''adminAccess']],function()
{ 
				Route::get('/admin', function () {
  
					  return view('backend.admin');
				
});
			});	


3.     Generate Resource Controller for employee.

Ans.     This is the easy part. From the command line in the root directory of your Laravel project, 
         type: php artisan make:controller employeeController --resource 
        This will create our resource controller with all the methods we need.
